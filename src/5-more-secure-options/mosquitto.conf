#                           LISTENERS
###################################################################

# Listen for incoming network connection on the specified port
# binding to the specified address
# Note: If this variable is used and neither the global bind_address
#       nor port options are used then the default listener will not
#       be started
listener 8883 127.0.0.1

# Limit the total number of clients connected for the current listener
max_connections 2

# Structuring topics in a tree helps to separate data channels and provide
# a logical order of information. However, this can lead to very long topic
# names being used during the publication of messages, hence increasing the
# size of each message.
# Topic aliases allow to circumvent this. Instead of the topic string, an
# integer value is sent
max_topic_alias 0

# This option is used with the listener option to isolate groups of clients.
# When a client connects to a listener which uses this option, the string
# argument is attached to the start of all topics for this client. This
# prefix is removed when any messages are sent to the client.
#
# Example:
# - The subscriber subscribes to topic "/mytopic"
#   => The broker appends /mountPoint to the topic then
#      + never notifies the subscriber if /mountPoint/mytopic is not allowed in aclFile.txt
#      + will notify the suscriber if /mountPoint/mytopic is allowed in aclFile.txt
# - The publisher publishes to topic "/mytopic"
#   => The broker appends /mountPoint to the topic then
#      + "rejects" the publication if /mountPoint/mytopic is not allowed in aclFile.txt
#      + accepts the publication if /mountPoint/mytopic is allowed in aclFile.txt
mount_point /mountPoint

# By default, a listener will attempt to listen on all supported IP protocol
# versions. Set to ipv4 to force the listener to only use IPv4
socket_domain ipv4
